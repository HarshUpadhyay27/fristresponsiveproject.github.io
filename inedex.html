            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5. Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can
                teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational
                institution) and all other aspects of operation. Hence, the differentiation of government schools and
                private schools can be misleading</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online education in India has come a long way with the development of
                technology. India is one of the nations that is developing at an exponential rate in terms of
                technology. With the population of more than 1.3 billion, the availability of high-speed internet and
                smartphones, India has the most number of technologically driven persons. The rise of the internet has
                changed the way of life in India. People like to do everything online, they shop online, do business
                online, make friends online, learn online etc. While eCommerce being the most significant online
                industry, Online education and learning stand right next to it. With the ever-increasing information
                available on the internet and the countless number of online courses many people in India prefer to
                learn online.</p>

                services are the two most important decisions the home ministry will announce in its soon-to-be-released
                guidelines for Unlock 4, which will begin from September 1. Reports said while metro and local trains
                may get a nod for limited services, schools will not be reopening in September. However, several state
                governments have announced their decisions regarding the opening of the schools. Majority of the parents
                are not in favour of sending their children to schools at a time when India is witnessing the highest
                daily number of cases in the world. Teachers and staff, however, have been asked to join the duty from
                September.</p>
